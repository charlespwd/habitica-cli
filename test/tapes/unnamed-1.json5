Quickly, Habitica, band together and strike through your tasks, and all of us will battle this monster together. (There\'s no need to abandon previous quests -  we believe in your ability to double-strike!) It won\'t attack us individually, but the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its Neglect Strike - and I don\'t like the way it\'s eyeing the Tavern....',

Crowds of cheering Habiticans line the shores! We\'ve helped Matt, Daniel, and Alex rebuild their buildings. But what\'s this?\n\n`The Citizens Return!`\n\nNow that the Drag\'on has fled, thousands of sparkling colors are ascending through the sea. It is a rainbow swarm of Mantis Shrimp... and among them, hundreds of merpeople!\n\n"We are the lost citizens of Dilatory!" explains their leader, Manta. "When Dilatory sank, the Mantis Shrimp that lived in these waters used a spell to transform us into merpeople so that we could survive. But in its rage, the Dread Drag\'on trapped us all in the dark crevasse. We have been imprisoned there for hundreds of years - but now at last we are free to rebuild our city!"\n\n"As a thank you," says his friend @Ottl, "Please accept this Mantis Shrimp pet and Mantis Shrimp mount, as well as XP, gold, and our eternal gratitude."\n\n`Rewards`\n * Mantis Shrimp Pet\n * Mantis Shrimp Mount\n * Chocolate, Cotton Candy Blue, Cotton Candy Pink, Fish, Honey, Meat, Milk, Potato, Rotten Meat, Strawberry',

"When Dilatory sank, the Mantis Shrimp that lived in these waters used a spell to transform us into merpeople so that we could survive. But in its rage, the Dread Drag\'on trapped us all in the dark crevasse. We have been imprisoned there for hundreds of years - but now at last we are free to rebuild our city!"\n\n"As a thank you," says his friend @Ottl, "Please accept this Mantis Shrimp pet and Mantis Shrimp mount, as well as XP, gold, and our eternal gratitude."\n\n`Rewards`\n * Mantis Shrimp Pet\n * Mantis Shrimp Mount\n * Chocolate, Cotton Candy Blue, Cotton Candy Pink, Fish, Honey, Meat, Milk, Potato, Rotten Meat, Strawberry',

These four are a mockery, each possessing only a fragment of what I once had! I commanded every spell and learned every skill. I shaped your very world to my whim — until the traitorous aether itself collapsed under the weight of my talents and my perfectly reasonable expectations. I have been trapped for millennia in this resulting void, recuperating. Imagine my disgust when I learned how my legacy had been corrupted.” She lets out a low, echoing laugh. “My plan was to destroy their domains before destroying them, but I suppose the order is irrelevant.” With a burst of uncanny strength, she charges forward, and the Realm of Void explodes into chaos.',

Everything probably became deserts like this.”<br><br>“No wonder the ancients who founded Habitica stressed a balance of productivity and wellness,” the Joyful Reaper murmurs. “Rebuilding their world would have been a daunting task requiring considerable hard work, but they would have wanted to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.”<br><br>“Oho, look at those formerly possessed items!” says the April Fool. Sure enough, all of them shimmer with a pale, glimmering translucence from the final burst of aether released when you laid Anti’zinnya’s spirit to rest. “What a dazzling effect. I must take notes.”<br><br>“The concentrated remnants of aether in this area probably caused these animals to go invisible, too,” says Lady Glaciate, scratching a patch of emptiness behind the ears. You feel an unseen fluffy head nudge your hand, and suspect that you’ll have to do some explaining at the Stables back home. As you look at the ruins one last time, you spot all that remains of the first Masterclasser: her shimmering cloak.

Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating! Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Inventory > Quests. There are four ways to get a scroll:\n * When you invite people to your Party, you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!\n * At level 15, you get a Quest-line, i.e., three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively.\n * You can buy Quests from the Quests Shop (Shops > Quests) for Gold and Gems.\n * When you check in to Habitica a certain number of times, you'll be rewarded with Quest Scrolls. You earn a Scroll during your 1st, 7th, 22nd, and 40th check-ins.\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading may be required to see the Boss's Health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
